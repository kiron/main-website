<p>Things are moving fast at Wings University. We are delighted to share with you the successful developments our project has made over the last months. Since it’s launch, Wings University has attracted more than 14000 refugees who have shown a strong interest in pursuing their higher education with us. Thank you for your support!
</p>
<p>Along with our growth, we are happy to take the next big step from a pure online university to a blended learning institution, and change our interim project name “Wings University” to “Kiron” as a result of an intense discussion process with our students. In Greek mythology “Kiron” was a symbol for wisedom and kindness. He was skilled inter alia in medicine and became the teacher of several Greek heros. After donating his immortality in favor of Prometheus, Zeus honored him with a place in the sky. We believe that the combination of education and kindness is the key to solve the problems refugees are facing and allow them to reach for the sky.
</p>
<p>We are also proud to announce that we are partnering with providers of open online courses like edX, Hasso Plattner Institute and iversity, who host hundreds of courses taught by world-leading experts from universities like Harvard, Stanford, MIT and Yale. Moreover, we have created partnerships with numerous universities, where Wings University students will be applying to pursue their third year, and graduate with a Bachelor degree. We will also open our own campus in Berlin in 2016. More information will follow. Moreover by integrating the latest e-learning technologies, such as Duolingo or Google for Education, as well as software solutions by SAP and Keepod, we are able to provide an innovative and state of the art environment for open, higher education.
