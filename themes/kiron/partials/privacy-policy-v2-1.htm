The Buddy Programme aims to socially integrate Kiron students by introducing interested participants to students.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"><br>If you want to participate in the buddy Programme, you will have to consent to the following:<br><br>1. Registration<br>For participation in the Buddy Programme as a Buddy, you need to register with your email-address. When registering your email-address you are also asked to provide a password. Password and email-address can then be used to log back into the application service to complete the application. The password is stored only in a hashed format, which allows us to verify that the correct password has been entered, but does not allow us to get access to the password itself.<br><br>2. Matching<br>Kiron may offer you to get in touch with other people in your vicinity. <br><br>Both the student and the Buddy have to explicitly register to be part of the Buddy Programme. Kiron will then try to find a suitable Buddy for the student and will then establish contact via email between student and Buddy. <br><br>Registered Buddies may provide the following types of information, which Kiron may use to match the Buddy to a suitable student:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;languages spoken, and languages you are interested in learning<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gender and preferred gender of student<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;location, according to the level of detail of your choice<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your expectations<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;university name<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your hobbies<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The selection of Buddy-Student pairs will be based on a matching algorithm developed by Kiron, taking the information above into account, but can also be conducted by individuals working at Kiron.<br><br><br>3. Establishing contact<br>After Kiron has found a match between a Buddy and a Kiron Student, Kiron will support you in getting in touch. For this purpose the matched student will receive an email with the following information:<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your name<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;email address<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;phone number (if provided)<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you city (but not your address, even if you were more specific on the location details)<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your gender<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as well as all the other information you had provided for matching (i.e. expectations, hobbies, etc., see above)<br><br>4. Additional Information via mail, email and other means<br>Kiron may send you updated information via email or other messaging services, such as WhatsApp, for which the respective contact details are used. Such messages may include information about our products and recent developments.
