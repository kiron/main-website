<p dir="ltr">The Kiron Engineering Department lets our students acquire the knowledge of scientific and technical fundamentals in different fields of engineering and teaches an engineering approach to solving real-life problems.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Key Learning Outcomes</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Kiron is currently offering Mechanical Engineering and planning to add more engineering tracks soon. Kiron Mechanical Engineering Study Track starts with scientific fundamentals in subjects such as mathematics, physics and chemistry. These are followed by more technical foundations in mechanics, materials science, thermodynamics, electronics and manufacturing technologies. Interdisciplinary skills in project management, quality management and business administration are also covered to different extents.</p>

<p dir="ltr">After successfully completing one of the engineering tracks, our students will&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">

		<p dir="ltr">have gained the fundamental skills and mindset that any engineer must have in the first place,</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">

		<p dir="ltr">be able to analyze real-world problems and approach them analytically,</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">

		<p dir="ltr">be able to develop engineering models and apply them to solve actual engineering problems.</p>
