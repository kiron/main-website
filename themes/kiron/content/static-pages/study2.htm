<p><strong data-verified="redactor">​The Blended Learning Model.</strong></p>
<p>Kiron believes that the future of higher education is blended learning: the combination of traditional and web-based education. The flexibility that this model offers is already improving access to education for refugees all over the world.</p>
<p>A degree at Kiron has two stages: online and offline. Through our innovative online education platform, Kiron students can begin their studies anywhere in the world, according to their own schedule. The only formal requirement to study via this platform is proof of refugee status (you can find more details under “Admissions”). Students only need to fulfil university entrance requirements at a later stage when applying to one of our partner universities. This means that refugees do not lose time while going through the lengthy legal process of seeking asylum.</p>
<p><strong data-verified="redactor"> Massive Open Online Courses. </strong></p>
<p>In designing our courses, we utilise one of the most exciting innovations in education of the last few years: Massive Open Online Courses. These online courses, offered by leading universities such as Harvard and MIT, are aimed at unlimited participation and access, and can be used for free by everyone.</p>
<p>We select those MOOCS which meet the European Higher Education Quality Standards, customise them with the latest e-learning technology, and design online learning modules which can be combined into cohesive study tracks. The Kiron education platform offers online tutoring, coworking, and student support, as well as real-life working sessions.</p>
<p>All of this is done with the careful supervision of our partner universities as well as experts in education and established educational institutions. The online courses help refugees prepare for offline study at our partner universities, who also award credit points towards a Bachelor degree for many of our MOOCs.</p><p><strong data-verified="redactor">Orientation and Preparation</strong></p>
<p>We believe that academic success is best achieved when education is tailored to the specific needs of the student. Given the challenges our students face every day, an accordingly designed phase of orientation and preparation is crucial.</p><p>During the orientation phase, students gain an insight through our online education platform into the requirements of higher education, and into their different study options. This includes introductory courses to specific fields of study, in order to enable our students to make an informed choice between study tracks. It also involves courses that cultivate transferable skills such as academic writing. Language courses in preparation for study are also available during this phase.</p>
<p><strong data-verified="redactor">Accreditation. </strong></p>
<p><u> Accredited Degrees through Partner Universities. </u></p>
<p>We secure accredited degrees for our students by partnering with accredited higher education institutions worldwide. Together, we form learning agreements, by which the universities recognize certain MOOCs available on the Kiron online platform. These courses then count as credit points towards a degree at one of the partner universities.</p>
<p>Students can apply to study at one of our partner universities as soon as all requirements for enrollment at a traditional university are met. This will include legal requirements such as a residence permit having been granted, and also involves academic requirements. Students must have completed at least 2 semesters of credit-eligible online courses (60 credit points), and achieved the required language level of the relevant study program according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.</p>
<p>In order to transfer to a partner university, Kiron students usually apply through the normal admissions procedure or as international students. After being accepted for a study program, students will then get their credits previously earned with Kiron recognized, which  significantly shortens the time needed to complete their studies. The accredited degree will then be awarded by the partner university, after successful completion of the study program.</p>
<p><u>Kiron Certificates</u></p><p><u></u><span>Kiron also provides general certificates to those students who have successfully completed at least 3 credit-eligible MOOCs through our General Studies program or the specific study tracks. These are an important proof of the skills Kiron students acquire through our online courses, and can for example be attached to job applications should the student decide to progress into the job market rather than to a partner university.</span></p>
