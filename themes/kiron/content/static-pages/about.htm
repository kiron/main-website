<p><strong data-verified="redactor">Less than 1% of refugees globally have access to higher education. </strong></p><p>At Kiron, we believe that everybody has the right to fulfill their potential and improve their life prospects via education. And we know that the obstacles refugees face in accessing education can be overcome. </p><p>Our vision is to provide millions of refugees worldwide with the opportunity to graduate with an accredited university degree, free of charge. No more time, potential, or lives wasted. </p><p>Kiron uses an innovative combination of online and offline learning to provide accessible, sustainable, and cost-effective education. To date, we have over 1,000 students, 23 partner universities, and 4 degree programmes. That's over 1,000 lives changed already. </p><p>Kiron offers much more than just online learning. Our vision is to reinvent the traditional concept of a university: with a diverse range of partners, we are striving to create an education model that is more accessible, more human-centred, and more supportive of personal growth. </p><p>
