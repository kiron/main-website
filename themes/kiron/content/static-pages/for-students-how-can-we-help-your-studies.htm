<h1 dir="ltr">How can we help with your studies?</h1>

<p dir="ltr"><img class="fr-dib fr-draggable" src="/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/KironServicesOverview.jpg" style="width: 1000px;" data-result="success"></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Our aim is to design services for you that empower you and help overcome challenges presented when studying in a new country and studying online.</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Buddy Program</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">A Buddy will be your local or online contact during your studies. They will introduce you to life in your new country and empower you to overcome cultural and everyday challenges. From language tandems to football buddies, cooking sessions to museum visits, you and your Buddy are free to engage in whatever activities you would like. As a participant in the Buddy Programme, you will become part of an international community. We will do our best to find a buddy that lives close to you. In case that cannot be arranged we encourage you to meet your buddy online. Please keep in mind that it can take a couple of weeks for us to find you a suitable buddy.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Study Hubs</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Study Hubs are of major importance for the success of the Kiron study programme and address Kiron students but also refugees in the process of becoming university or Kiron students. They facilitate learning with online resources by providing access to internet and hardware. In cooperation with partner universities, local initiatives and volunteers, these spaces ideally do not solely provide a place to take online courses, but also a room for study programmes such as language lessons, tutoring and peer-to-peer coaching. Moreover, this kind of offline support fosters the student community and strengthens the motivation of Kiron students through complementary direct interaction.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Academic Advisory</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Since every student at Kiron brings their own educational background and motivation to study, we want to give you some direction during the online part. It is designed to have a long-term contact who knows the Kiron model very well and has an academic background of your study field to support you structuring online studies. In one-on-one meetings with your advisor, you will discuss your personal short-term goals and how you will achieve them. This 10 month programme beginning September 2016 offers guidance in self-organization, requires your active participation in updating your learning journal weekly, and includes discussing learning progress and obstacles to overcome.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Career Services</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Our goal is to ensure the Kiron students have the tools necessary to prepare for the job market. We help our students by providing useful information on topics such as writing a proper CV, how to write a cover letter and how to apply for internships and jobs in general.
	<br>We are constantly working on connecting with employers, and will continue to strengthen our network of companies that may provide internships.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Counselling Services</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">To study also means facing a lot of demands in all parts of life. Not everything works out smoothly. Sometimes, there are problems and difficulties that are too hard to overcome on your own. If this is the case, please contact us! With our team of professionals we will support you in any questions concerning your studies as well as personal conflicts or problems via video chat, email or, when possible, locally in person.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We can help you in situations where you have …</p>

<p dir="ltr">… difficulties with your studies (concentration problems, self organization, loss of motivation, fear of exams, ...),</p>

<p dir="ltr">… current crisis, anxiety, depressive mood, low self-esteem,</p>

<p dir="ltr">… stressful family or social situations,&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">… problems in contact with others,&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">… specific problems with being in a foreign country,&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">… problems in personal relationships?</p>

<p dir="ltr">… addiction issues</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Direct Academics</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">During the online part of the curriculum, you have the freedom to set your own study schedule. Online courses (MOOCs) from different providers can be selected on the study platform Kiron Campus. Modules filled with MOOCs build the core curriculum. These courses often are taught without live sessions and therefore without any direct contact between professor and you. Therefore, Direct Academics offers live-online-sessions where you can meet instructors on a weekly basis. This way, you can interact with each other and the instructor virtually in tutorials to successfully complete MOOCs and getting prepared for new learning content.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Besides tutorials, Direct Academics offers live language courses online in cooperation with the Language School. Within these courses different language skills are trained such as, conversation, academic writing, and study field specific vocabulary for English and German language.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Language School</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">The Kiron Language School offers you a selection of online and offline courses led by professional teachers and qualified language institutions. These language courses aim to train your language skills to support you during your Kiron studies and future education at partner universities.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As an online study platform, our language courses are available in different digital formats such as virtual classrooms, online live-teaching sessions, etc. In addition to the online language learning platforms, Kiron Language School can also offer offline language courses where students learn in traditional classroom settings.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Kiron Language School also provides you with the tools for independent studying, so that students can learn on their own using for example app-based language resources. Such learning methods mean flexibility - you can learn independently and manage your own speed, time and location of learning.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Overall, the Kiron Language Team supports you with a variety of language learning possibilities, to allow you to learn according to your own individual preferences.</p>
