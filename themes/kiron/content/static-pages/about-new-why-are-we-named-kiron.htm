<h1 dir="ltr">Why are we named Kiron?</h1>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Kiron’s founders, Markus and Vincent, wanted to come up with an expressive name that held a relevant meaning. Because Kiron is based on a global idea, Markus and Vincent envisioned a name with a global understanding. Kiron’s main points are higher education and accessibility for everyone, two pillars that have their origins in Greece as this is where democracy and higher education developed.</p>

<p dir="ltr">After doing some research, Markus and Vincent found Chiron, a centaur famous in Greek mythology for his superior knowledge and teaching ability. He was the eldest and wisest of all centaurs. As knowledge and teaching are essential to Kiron, they quickly agreed that they would derive a name from Chiron. However, they wanted it to be easy for people of all origins to pronounce, and that’s how it came to be Kiron. &nbsp;</p>
