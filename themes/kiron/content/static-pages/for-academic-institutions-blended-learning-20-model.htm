<p dir="ltr">At Kiron, studying comes in several dimensions: online and offline, synchronous and asynchronous. Through our online education platform, students begin their studies online from anywhere in the world, allowing them to study according to their own schedule, but also get access to synchronous live courses. The students can then apply to continue their studies offline at one of our partner universities. This means that they do not lose any time while going through the lengthy process of seeking asylum and organizing the relevant documents to enter a university.&nbsp;</p>
