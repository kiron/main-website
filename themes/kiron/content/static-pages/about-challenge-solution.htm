<p>Refugees face many obstacles in accessing higher education. The United Nations Human Rights Council identify four main barriers in their current Education Strategy.</p>

<p><strong data-verified="redactor">1) Legal.&nbsp;</strong>Refugees often do not have access to the documents necessary to apply for university, for example high school certificates in the home country, or a passport. Traditional universities require proof of permission to reside in the host country, which can take years to finalise, and refugees are unable to study during this time.</p>

<p><strong data-verified="redactor">2) Language.</strong> Universities have certain language requirements, which refugees new to the host country are often unable to fulfil.</p>

<p><strong data-verified="redactor">3) Financial.</strong> Refugees generally cannot afford the tuition fees associated with a traditional university education, and the cost to host governments of supporting them would be high.</p>

<p><strong data-verified="redactor">4) University capacity.</strong> Traditional universities can only offer places to a certain number of students, with funded places even more rare, and so often do not have the capacity to cope with large numbers of refugees.</p>

<p>This situation means that the process of seeking asylum, which can take years, is lost time for most refugees. They are unable to continue or begin their education, despite being motivated to learn and fulfil their potential academically and professionally. For a large proportion, one of the many things they have lost is their studies - for example, 25% of Syrians aged 18-24 studied before war broke out. When refugees arrive in a host country, lack of job prospects makes building a new life and integrating into society difficult.</p>

<p>Nobody benefits from this situation. Successful integration is key to retaining global stability in the face of the current refugee crisis. The infrastructures of host countries face enormous and unnecessary strain from difficulties in integrating refugees socially and economically.</p>

<p>
	<br><strong data-verified="redactor">Our education model.<br></strong></p>

<p>We believe that the future of higher education is blended learning, a combination of offline and online education. A study programme at Kiron therefore has two component parts.</p>

<p>First, students participate in two years of online study, from anywhere in the world and according to their own schedule. Our innovative online platform offers rigorous and interactive courses, with 4 study tracks to choose from. We work with NGOs to provide internet access and study hubs in many countries worldwide, and sponsor the purchase of laptops and other hardware for studying.</p>

<p>After completing the online study phase, and once their residence status has been finalised, students then complete their degree with one to two years at one of our partner universities, with a choice of 18 universities in diverse locations. These partner universities award credit points for many of Kiron's online courses, meaning that they count towards the final degree.</p>

<p>Our vision is not just to overcome the obstacles refugees face to access university but to build a better, more human-centered university that fosters personal growth. Our students benefit from access to psychological counselling, mentoring programmes, and student support services. We collaborate with corporate organisations in host countries to provide internships and trainee programmes for our students, to help them make a seamless transition into work.

<p><strong data-verified="redactor">A targeted solution.</strong></p>

<p>This innovative education model is designed to surmount all four of the access challenges faced by refugees.</p>

<p><strong data-verified="redactor">1) Legal.</strong> Our students can begin studying at all stages of the displacement and resettlement process - they do not have to wait for their legal status to be finalised. All our students need to begin their studies through our online platform is proof of refugee status.</p>

<p><strong data-verified="redactor">2) Language.</strong> Students do not have to fulfil any language requirements to study through our online platform. In our language school, Kiron students can gain the necessary language skills to attend partner universities in the home country.</p>

<p><strong data-verified="redactor">3) Financial.&nbsp;</strong>Kiron charges no admission fees. Because our content is online, our costs per student are extremely low. We cover these via a combination of funding, investments, and donations; we work with independent organisations to achieve financial transparency and release an annual report of our finances.</p>

<p><strong data-verified="redactor">4) College capacity.&nbsp;</strong>Because Kironâ€™s courses are online, we do not face the same capacity issues as traditional universities. As students only attend partner universities for one year, less strain is placed on the university system by need for extra places.</p>

<p>Our support services are designed to help refugees overcome specific problems that can act as a personal barrier to fulfilling their potential, such as trauma, difficulties integrating into social life and the job market, and lack of resources such as internet and computer access.</p>

<p>Through our start-up incubator, Migration Hubs, and research department, we also support continuing research and innovation in migration and education solutions. You can find out more <a href="https://kiron.ngo/world" target="_blank">here</a>.
