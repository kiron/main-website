<p dir="ltr">Kiron’s study process has been divided into two stages, online and offline. The online courses enable the students with the flexibility to take courses from anywhere in the world and according to their own schedule. Our courses are designed to utilise Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), one of the most exciting innovations in education of the last few years. Kiron’s study tracks use courses designed by leading universities like Harvard, MIT or RWTH Aachen ensuring that key learning outcomes are in line with world renowned courses. There are currently four study tracks to choose from: Business, Engineering, Computer Science, and Social Science. Once a student has chosen the study track, they can then enrol in the relevant online modules that will count towards a degree at one of our partner Universities. As a student, you can apply to study at a partner university as soon as all of the requirements for enrollment at a traditional university are met including legal and language requirements. After they have been accepted, students then apply to have their credits from studying with Kiron recognized by a partner University.</p>
