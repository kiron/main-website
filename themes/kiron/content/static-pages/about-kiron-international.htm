<h1>Kiron International</h1>

<p dir="ltr">Kiron strives for the proof of concept internationally until 2018. This includes Germany, France as well as Turkey and Jordan. In these countries Kiron is operating with a team on the ground. The aim is to help our students in these regions to obtain a university degree. In this respect university partnerships are being established. In Turkey students will probably first be part of a certificate program which later on can lead to a university degree. Accomplished are the academic services with various services of student services which support students in their successful studies.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">To scale social impact Kiron is also operating outside of these focus countries. The Kiron platform is accessible globally, however the transfer to a partner university can only be achieved for students studying in one of the four countries until 2018. At a later stage post 2018 Kiron will scale across further countries in Europe the Middle East as well as Africa followed by America and Asia. &nbsp;</p>

<h1 dir="ltr">Focus Countries</h1>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Kiron Jordan</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Our team in Jordan has been on the ground since June 2016. Grace and Louisa came to establish Kiron’s second representation in the Middle East in order to be closer to the most vulnerable displaced persons and to adapt our model to the academic landscape in the Arab world. Kiron Jordan has established promising university partnerships, having signed agreements with Al al Bayt University and the Hashemite University and is working with local and international NGOs in order to provide students with study hubs, within the camps and the host communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">As of now, the office is fully run by Grace, who is also coordinating student outreach and support, and Louisa, who is focusing on university partnerships and academic development.</p>
