<h1 dir="ltr">Benefits of Kiron</h1>

<p dir="ltr">We all benefit from a solution to the refugee crisis. Kiron's work has a positive impact not only for refugees, but also for society, the economy, and the education system.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Benefits for Refugees</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Our innovative online learning tools and student support systems are designed with the specific needs of refugees in mind, and are not available at any other higher education institution.</p>

<p dir="ltr">One key advantage of the Kiron model is its flexibility. Refugees with families, can study from home in their free time. In addition, no time is lost while waiting for their legal status in the host country to be finalized. Our students are able to study throughout this period, graduate earlier, and contribute to their hosting society sooner.</p>

<p>Having an internationally accepted degree is a great opportunity for refugees to become contributing individuals in their new communities. It eases integration into their host community, and gives the potential opportunity to participate in rebuilding their home countries for the coming generations.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Benefits for Society</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Education is the key to a flourishing job market and economy. It is also essential for political stability and the peaceful coexistence of different nationalities and religions. Research shows that educated people tend to be more productive members of society, less extreme in their political or religious views, and integrate more easily into new environments.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Because the majority of our content is online, our cost per student is around 5% of normal government spending. By significantly lowering tuition costs, speeding up the integration process, and aiding refugees in finding employment, Kiron can help host country governments and infrastructures cope with the global refugee crisis.</p>

<p>We believe that access to education provides an easier and smoother transition for refugee men and women, and allows for an easier integration into a new society. Society will also gain skilled, responsible, and entrepreneurial citizens.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Benefits for Pedagogy</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">We believe that our blended learning concept is the future of academic education. Traditional universities and other educational institutions can therefore learn from the more accessible and interactive education model piloted by Kiron.</p>

<p dir="ltr">For example, we enable students to make more informed choices by allowing them to 'test drive' courses online before deciding on a degree programme. This idea could easily be extended to traditional universities and would increase student well-being and society's productivity.</p>
