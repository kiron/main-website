<h2>Become a partner</h2><p>Our partners are very diverse and range from passionate individuals to established institutions of Higher Education, unified by their passion to contribute to the development of Kiron and the improvement of the situation of refugees worldwide. The network of Kiron is built on academic, civil and technology partnerships.</p><p><strong>Academic Partners</strong></p><p>As we strive for the world’s best online education, we are constantly looking for academic institutions and individuals to partner with us. We usually start by establishing a Memorandum of Understanding, which includes a simple support statement on our website. However, this can easily be expanded to open study abroad capacities or the establishment of a full academic partnership, in which your university works as a host university for our students, providing the legal enrolment and granting the degree.</p><p><strong>Civil Society Partners</strong></p><p>We also work with foundations and NGOs that have built a strong reputation within the education, e-learning or refugee support fields. We want to offer refugees access to the world’s best higher education. In order to do so, we want to reach as many refugees as possible to inform them about Kiron. If you are working with refugees and you want to inform them about Kiron, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p><strong>Technology Partners</strong><br></p><p>As we are trying to create the world’s best online education, we are striving for the best learning experience, too. If you are about to create an innovative e-learning tool or you already established one, we would love to partner with you. We already established strong technology partnerships for example with keepod to provide refugees with access to personal computing. Our platform is the perfect idea lab and marketing platform for your business.</p><p>Thanks to the trust and continuous support of our partners, we are able to offer increasingly more courses and degrees. Their commitment to the vision of Kiron is key to our success.</p><p><a href="/contact" target="_blank">Contact Us</a></p><p>Discover more options to support Kiron</p><p><a href="/support/donations">Donate</a></p>
