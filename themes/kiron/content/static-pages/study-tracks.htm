==
<p>Kiron students can currently choose between four study tracks. Each offers a rigorous yet flexible curriculum that will prepare students for making a seamless transition into further education or a successful career.
</p><p>As well as gaining practical and theoretical knowledge in their field, Kiron graduates have excellent problem-solving and communication skills. They can deal with complex questions from an academic and logical perspective. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the programs, Kiron graduates are comfortable working collaboratively on projects beyond the scope of their own specialist subject.

</p><h3>Business &amp; Economics</h3><p>The Kiron Study Track in Business &amp; Economics allows students to specialise in their area of interest within an interdisciplinary environment.
</p><p>Students begin by learning the basics in both fields: foundations in algebra, statistics and the forces that drive our economy on a macro and micro level. Once the foundations are laid, students can choose to specialise in either Business or Economics. After transferring to the partner university, students are encouraged to specialise in an area of study within their field, such as marketing or finance.
</p><p>Key learning outcomes of the programmes offered in Business &amp; Economics include:
</p><ul>
	<li>the ability to analytically examine the economy from both a market and business perspective (including quantitative methods).</li>
	<li>the ability to make sustainable and responsible decisions in an increasingly complex and fast-moving environment</li>
	<li>gaining the transferable skills required to succeed in a future career.</li>
</ul><p>A degree in the field of Business and Economics offers excellent career opportunities across sectors, ranging from governmental institutions to private companies. Furthermore, a Bachelor degree in the field of Business and Economics qualifies students for a variety of Master’s degrees worldwide.

</p><h3>Engineering</h3><p>The Kiron Study Track in Engineering will enable students to apply theoretical fields such as mathematics and science practically, solving real life problems and turning ideas into reality. It prepares students for specialism in 5 different fields of engineering: Industrial, Civil, Mechanical, Environmental and Electrical.
</p><ul>
	<li>Industrial Engineering focuses on designing and optimizing industrial processes and systems.</li>
	<li>Civil Engineering deals with the design, construction and maintenance of our physical environment.</li>
	<li>Mechanical Engineering applies the principles of engineering, physics, and materials science for the design and maintenance of mechanical systems.</li>
	<li>Environmental engineering is concerned with designing solutions for adverse environmental effects, as well as improving environmental quality.</li>
	<li>Electrical Engineering is the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism.</li>
</ul><p>The core curriculum in the engineering track is built on foundation courses in the sciences and mathematics. Upon completing the core modules of the engineering programme, students may choose to specialize in one of the aforementioned areas and target a specific partner university degree.

</p><h3>Computer Science</h3><p>Digitalisation is the major trend of the 21st century. A degree in Computer Science will therefore enable students to follow a career in diverse industries, and help them solve the major issues of our time.
</p><p>The Kiron Study Track in Computer Science provides students with detailed knowledge in planning, creating, designing and using software. A deep understanding of the underlying mathematics enables our students to fully grasp the logic and structure behind the major coding languages. These skills will not only be taught as theoretical concepts, but also developed via practical exercises during the courses.
</p><p>Students seeking to apply for a degree in Computer Science should consider taking the introductory class in computer science during their first year. Additionally, students are encouraged to demonstrate their strength in logic and problem-solving by taking at least one mathematics module during the first year.

</p><h3>Social Sciences</h3><p>Students taking the Kiron Social Sciences Track can choose between various fields of interest, such as intercultural communication, pedagogy, social work or good governance. The respective study programs are all interdisciplinary, connected through the challenges faced by culturally diverse migration societies in the 21st century.
</p><p>Students on this track examine how different societal factors – such as language, culture, gender and religion – impact on social interactions among individuals and societies. Exploring different concepts of culture, diversity and inclusion set the framework for the studies. Once students have developed a particular interest, they are able to specialise according to the requirements of our partner universities.
