<p dir="ltr">Do you find maths to be a breeze? Do technical systems and technologies fascinate you? Then you should think about studying Engineering.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Kiron Engineering Study Track lets you acquire the knowledge of scientific and technical fundamentals in different fields of engineering and teaches you a technical &nbsp;approach to solving real-life problems. Upon completion of the core modules within the engineering field of your choice, you can choose to specialize in different subjects and target a specific Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Chemical or Environmental Engineering degree at a partner university.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Key Learning Outcomes</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Kironâ€™s Engineering Study Tracks start with scientific fundamentals in subjects such as mathematics, physics and chemistry. These are followed by more technical foundations required for the specific engineering field of your choice. They cover subjects such as mechanics, materials science, thermodynamics, electronics, or geotechnology. Interdisciplinary skills in project management, quality management and law are also covered to different extents in engineering curricula. After successfully completing one of the engineering tracks, you will&nbsp;</p>
