<p dir="ltr">Kiron is currently offering Mechanical Engineering Study Track for Kiron Students and planning to start offering others soon. Mechanical Engineering involves the design, production and operation of machinery; it opens the path towards academic and industrial positions in fields such as automotive, aerospace, manufacturing, energy and robotics. A degree in Mechanical Engineering opens up a vast variety of possibilities both in academia and in industry. Kiron Mechanical Engineering Study Track starts with scientific fundamentals in subjects such as mathematics, physics and chemistry. These are followed by more technical foundations in mechanics, materials science, thermodynamics, electronics and manufacturing technologies. Interdisciplinary skills in project management, quality management and business administration are also covered to different extents.</p>
