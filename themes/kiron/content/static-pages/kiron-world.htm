<p>Kiron's education program is just one part of what we offer. Our network of innovative educational, entrepreneurial, and research initiatives is aimed at targeting the broader issues of migration and developing pedagogy in the digital age. Kiron World is this ecosystem of initiatives for learning, personal growth, and integration.</p>

<p>Kiron's educational vision is not just about providing online courses, and not limited to its current application to the refugee crisis. Rather, we want to reinvent the traditional concept of a university. Our vision is of a new learning environment that is more, accessible, more human-centred, and more supportive of personal growth. We are also at the forefront of exploring how developments in technology can be used in creative ways to enhance learning.</p>

<p><span>However, Kiron's work is not limited to education: our goal is to find sustainable and innovative solutions to the global refugee crisis. The Kiron education model is just one of these. Kiron World involves a network of initiatives for supporting innovation and research in the areas of education and migration.&nbsp;</span></p>
