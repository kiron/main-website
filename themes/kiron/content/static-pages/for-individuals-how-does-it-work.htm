<p dir="ltr">Kiron’s study process has been divided into two stages, online and offline. The online courses enable students the flexibility to study from anywhere in the world and according to an individual’s schedule. Our courses are designed to utilise Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), one of the most exciting innovations in education of the last few years. Kiron’s study tracks have been designed by leading universities like Harvard, MIT and RWTH Aachen ensuring your key learning outcomes are in line with world renowned courses. There are four study tracks to choose from: Business, Engineering, Computer Science, and Social Science. Once students have chosen a study track, they can then enrol in the relevant online modules that will count towards a degree at one of our partner Universities. Students can apply to study at a partner university as soon as all of the requirements for enrollment at a traditional university are met including legal and language requirements. After being accepted, the completed MOOCs can be used to gain credits at a partner University.</p>
