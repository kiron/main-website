<p dir="ltr">Computing and computer technology are part of just about everything that touches our lives, from the cars we drive, to the movies we watch, to the numerous ways we all interact with each other. Whether you want to create the next hot application or want to make a positive difference in the world by developing innovative technology in science, studying computing gives our students a foundation of knowledge, problem solving skills and habits of logical thinking that will provide them with a competitive edge and a career that will never be obsolete. &nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Kiron Computer Science curriculum gives a profound introduction to the mathematical and engineering basics of the discipline and equips students with the tools and knowledge necessary for a successful research, industrial and entrepreneurial career in computing.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Key Learning Outcomes</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">A set of "core" courses gives students a thorough foundation in analysis, linear algebra, programming principles, algorithms, complexity management, and computing systems. It also provides considerable flexibility in course selection around topics such as Cryptography, Artificial Intelligence, Statistics and Web Programming. Interdisciplinary skills in business administration and law are also covered to complement the computer science curriculum.&nbsp;</p>
