<p>We all benefit from a solution to the refugee crisis. Kiron's work has a positive impact not just for refugees, but also for society, the economy, and education.<br></p><p><strong>Benefits for Refugees</strong>
</p><p>Our innovative online learning tools and student support system are designed with the specific needs of refugees in mind, and are not available at any other higher education institution.
</p><p>One key advantage of the Kiron model is its flexibility. Refugees whose financial status requires them to be in a full time job, or those with families, can study in their free time from home. They also waste no time while waiting for their legal status at their host countries to be finalized. Our students study throughout this period, graduate earlier, and contribute to their hosting society sooner.
</p><p>An internationally accepted degree is a great opportunity for refugees to become a contributing individual in their new community. It will ease their integration in their host community, and potentially give them the opportunity of participating in rebuilding their home countries for the coming generations.
</p><p><strong>Benefits for Society</strong>
</p><p>Education is the key to a flourishing job market and economy. It is also essential for political stability, and the peaceful coexistence of different nationalities and religions. Research shows that educated people tend to be more productive members of society, less extreme in their political or religious views, and integrate more easily into new environments.
</p><p>Because the majority of our content is online, our cost per student is around 5% of the normal government spending. By significantly lowering integration costs, speeding up the integration process, and aiding refugees in finding employment, Kiron can help host-country governments and infrastructures cope with the global refugee crisis.
</p><p>We believe that education is integration. Society will benefit from Kiron by the stability gained from fuller integration. It will also gain skilled, responsible, and entrepreneurial citizens. We offer faster integration, more skilled populations, and healthier societies.</p><p><strong>Benefits for Pedagogy</strong></p><p>We believe that our blended learning concept is the future of academic education. Traditional universities and other educational institutions can therefore learn from the more accessible and interactive education model piloted by Kiron.</p><p>Just one example: We enable students to make more informed study choices by allowing them to 'test drive' courses online before deciding upon a degree program. This idea could easily be extended to traditional universities, and would increase student well-being and society's productivity.</p>
