<p>As we develop innovative education based on blended learning, we are constantly looking to form partnerships with academic institutions. Partner universities can act as host universities for Kiron students in their third year of studies, granting enrollment and accreditation of selected courses, and conferring a regular degree. But there are many other ways for our academic partners to help, including providing access to facilities and volunteer online tutors. We are constantly extending our curriculum of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and always interested in new partnerships with high-class MOOC providers.
