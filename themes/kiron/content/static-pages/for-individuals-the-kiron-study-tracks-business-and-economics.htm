<p dir="ltr">The Business &amp; Economics core curriculum offers the best of both worlds: In our Economics modules, students will understand on a theoretical level how modern economies function and integrate into a larger social framework, while in our Business modules they will learn on a practical level how to lead a business organisation. Going through our Business &amp; Economics track and completing a degree at a partner university equips our students with a set of both intellectual and hands-on skills that make them particularly valuable job market candidates.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Key Learning Outcomes</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">In this study track, our students begin by learning the basics of both Business Administration and Economics, including for example foundations in maths &amp; statistics, marketing, accounting, human resources, and the forces that drive our economy on a macro and micro level.</p>
