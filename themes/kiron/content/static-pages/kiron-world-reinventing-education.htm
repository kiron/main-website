<p>We believe in the potential of online learning both to improve worldwide access to education, and to offer new, effective, and interactive ways of learning. The educational innovations we are pioneering are applicable in many contexts, not just for refugees.</p>

<p><strong>Language School</strong></p>

<p>In cooperation with partners such as Lingua TV, Babbel and Language Testing Service, we provide a diverse set of language learning offers in both German and English to our students.</p>

<p>New ways of teaching German are explored in the pilot project Klassenzimmer 2.0 in cooperation with Leuphana University, which allows students to participate interactively with other students and teachers in a virtual classroom.</p>

<p><strong>Direct Academics</strong></p>

<p>We are always looking to pioneer effective ways of making online education more interactive. Through our Direct Academics program, qualified academics volunteer to provide real-time interactive online tutorials in their field of expertise for students via our education platform.</p>

<p>Students can get personal feedback, targeted help with skills such as academic writing, and benefit from personal contact with experts in their field of study.</p>

<p><strong>Study Hubs</strong></p>

<p>We work with local initiatives, NGOs, and volunteers to provide our students in various locations worldwide with Study Hubs. These Hubs facilitate online learning by providing internet and computer access, and strengthen the student community by allowing students to meet and exchange. The spaces are also used for language lessons, tutoring and peer-to-peer coaching.</p>
