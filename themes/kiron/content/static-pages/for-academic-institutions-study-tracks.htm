<h2 dir="ltr">Study Tracks</h2>

<p dir="ltr">Kironâ€™s curriculum development is separated into four study tracks: Social Sciences, Business &amp; Economics, Computer Science and Engineering. Below, we want to give you a first impression of what you can experience at Kiron, academically.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Core Curricula and Prep Courses</strong></p>

<p>Each study track consists of one common core curriculum and facultative preparatory courses. To account for the huge diversity in academic backgrounds of our students, we are offering track-specific prep courses to bridge the gap from the individual student's knowledge to the level needed to follow our university-level courses. These courses are facultative but strongly recommended for the students to avoid frustration with too difficult courses of the core curriculum. We are currently working on entry-assessments to guide each student in the appropriate course-level.&nbsp;</p>
