<h1 dir="ltr">Kiron for Individuals</h1>

<p dir="ltr">Welcome to Kiron!</p>

<p dir="ltr">We believe that everybody has the right to fulfill their potential and improve their life prospects through education.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Our personal well-being is often directly connected to the opportunities that we are given in life. We understand that refugees face additional obstacles that they cannot influence on their own. Kiron’s aim is to help close this opportunity gap and overcome these additional obstacles, which we truly believe is an achievable goal. The technology exists and the need is there, and that’s why we are here.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Our vision is to provide millions of refugees worldwide with the opportunity to graduate with an accredited university degree, free of charge. No more time and potential wasted.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We are at the forefront of driving innovation and research in education and migration solutions. But in order to achieve our goals, we depend on the skills of many people, partners, volunteers and donations in order to implement our approach of providing easily accessible education for refugees.</p>
