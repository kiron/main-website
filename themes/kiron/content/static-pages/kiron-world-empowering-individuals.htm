<p>â€‹We want not just to enable our students to excel academically: just as important is creating a new university environment which is more supportive of personal growth.</p>

<p><strong>EmPower Program.</strong></p>

<p>The EmPower Program is designed specifically to empower refugees by targeting two of the challenges they face: integration into the new society and job market, and access to psychosocial support. The Program has three branches:</p>

<p>Buddy Program: We partner with volunteer students from local universities who act as local contacts for Kiron students, offering support and advice and introducing Kiron students to the student life in their city.</p>

<p>Mentoring Program: Our mentors help students prepare for their future career, serve as role models, and give insights into organizations. We cooperate with non-profit Kwantum Mentoring Ltd, which provides a team of dedicated, trained and multilingual mentors.</p>

<p>Psychosocial Support: &nbsp;&nbsp;Exposure to violence, disaster, and separation from loved ones, in conjunction with lack of access to services, can all have immediate and long-term consequences for the psychosocial well-being of refugees. Therefore, our students have both online and offline access to our team of professional psychologists.</p>

<p><strong>Careers Guidance.</strong></p>

<p>Our ultimate goal is to pave our student&rsquo;s way into the job market. We want to empower people to make their own living, while making best use of their skills and knowledge.</p>

<p>We therefore help our students to gain valuable practical experience through internships, and support them in finding permanent employment in their area of interest once they leave us. Through a partnership with a recognized job platform we connect our students with employers, and are constantly working to build our strong network of companies who can provide internships and employment to our students.&nbsp;</p>
