<h1 dir="ltr">Our Challenge</h1>

<p dir="ltr">Refugees face many obstacles in accessing higher education. The United Nations Human Rights Council identifies four main barriers in their current education strategy:</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>1) Legal.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Refugees often do not have access to the documents necessary to apply for university, for example high school certificates from their home country or a passport. Traditional universities require proof of permission to reside in the host country, which can take years to finalise, and refugees are unable to study during this time.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>2) Language.</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Universities have certain language requirements that refugees new to the host country are often unable to fulfill.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>3) Financial.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Refugees generally cannot afford the tuition fees associated with a traditional university education, and the cost for host governments to support them can be high.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>4) University capacity.</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Traditional universities can only offer places to a certain number of students, and funded places are even more rare. They often do not have the capacity to cope with large numbers of refugees.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This situation means that the process of seeking asylum, which can take years, is lost time for most refugees. They are unable to continue or begin their education, despite being motivated to learn and fulfill their potential academically and professionally. For a large proportion, one of the many things they have lost is their studies - for example, 25% of Syrians aged 18-24 studied before the war started. When refugees arrive in a host country, a lack of job prospects makes building a new life and integrating into society difficult.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Nobody benefits from this situation. Successful integration is key to retaining global stability in the face of the current refugee crisis. The infrastructure of host countries faces enormous and unnecessary strain from difficulty in integrating refugees socially and economically.</p>

<h1 dir="ltr">Our targeted solution</h1>

<p dir="ltr">Our innovative education model is designed to surmount all four of the access challenges faced by refugees.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>1) Legal.</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Our students can begin studying at all stages of the displacement and resettlement process - they do not have to wait for their legal status to be finalised. Students are given flexible options to prove refugee status.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>2) Language.</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Students do not have to fulfill any language requirements to study through our online platform. Our language assessment is only for identifying the English level the students currently have. In our language school, Kiron students can gain the necessary language skills to attend partner universities in the host country.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>3) Financial.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Kiron charges no admission fees. Because our content is online, our costs per student are low compared to a traditional course. Fortunately, costs are covered through a combination of funding, investments, and donations. We work with independent organisations to achieve financial transparency and release an annual report of our finances.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>4) College capacity.</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Because Kironâ€™s courses are online, we do not face the same capacity issues as traditional universities. As students only attend partner universities for two years, less strain is placed on the university system.</p>

<p>Our support services are designed to help refugees overcome specific problems that can act as a personal barrier to fulfilling their potential, such as trauma, difficulties integrating into social lif</p>
