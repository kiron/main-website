<h1>Option 1: Development and recognition of our Study Program</h1>

<p>Development and recognition of our Study Program is at the heart of our mission. Kiron students transfer to a Partner University, after they have completed the online-phase of their studies. At the &nbsp;Partner University, students receive an accredited University degree. Individual recognition of learning done at Kiron is being supported by Learning Agreements. Kiron students must fulfill university specific requirements -- as any other student wishing to study at the Partner University.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed Process Overview</strong></p>

<p><em>Step 1: Establishing contact and defining responsibilities</em></p>

<p>After the initial contact, the responsible person at Kiron and at the Partner University coordinate the combined efforts towards establishing a partnership. During this process, both parties agree on mutually set goals as well as the nature of the collaboration.</p>

<p><em>Step 2: Capturing mutual goals in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)</em></p>

<p>The Partner University and Kiron agree on detailed goals of the partnership as well as their intention to work together by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). This document indicates the intended common line of action and a relationship of goodwill between the parties.</p>

<p><em>Step 3: Curriculum Development &amp; Equivalence Course List</em></p>

<p>Kiron offers its core curriculum to the partner university, which then chooses the modules that it wants to recognize as part of their own study program. Kiron core modules are designed as to fit into maximally many curricula at partner universities, by focusing on those learning outcomes that the average student is expected to achieve in the course of studying a particular subject.</p>

<p><em>Step 4: Signing of a Learning Agreement</em></p>

<p>After successful process of curriculum matching, a final Learning Agreement, &nbsp;indicating the respective learning outcomes, is signed by both parties. This ensures students can choose their study track and be certain they will gain credits when applying to the partner University.</p>

<p><em>Step 5: Transfer of Kiron students to partner university?</em></p>

<p>If the students decide to transfer to one of &nbsp;Kiron’s partner universities, the application process is the same as for any other prospective student. After having been accepted, the students will then apply to have their credits recognized at the university’s examination office (Prüfungsbüro). At the moment there exist mainly two different recognition processes. Firstly, the student´s prior studies or work experiences that are considered equivalent to the University’s respective study course can be recognized as "außerhochschulische Leistung" (external academic achievement). As a second option the students will have to pass examinations based on the University’s assessment of the completed online-modules.

To reduce the effort for the local examination office, our Curriculum Department regularly coordinates the Kiron curricula with them.</p>
