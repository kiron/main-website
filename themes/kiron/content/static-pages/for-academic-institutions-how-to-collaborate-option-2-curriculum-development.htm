<h1 dir="ltr">Option 2: Curriculum development</h1>

<p dir="ltr">The curriculum development entails two types of collaboration with our academic partners: 1) Direct Academics program, and 2) MOOCs development.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>DA Cooperation</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Our Direct Academics department supplements each subject-department’s study program with interactive learning experiences for students. The Direct Academics classes increase student-teacher contact hours through live-online teaching sessions, which enhances the learning experience of Kiron students. Thus this enables students to receive personal feedback and support that is greatly beneficial in helping them reach personal study and career goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">There are several ways volunteering academics could get involved with the Direct Academics program:</p>

<p dir="ltr">Within the Direct Academics program volunteer instructors support Kiron students by giving module-based tutorials in live meetings online in their field of expertise. We are looking for input from academics interested in creating and providing these tutorials as well as from people who have an interest in developing this concept further.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, Direct Academics offers online language courses to students to improve their academic writing skills, practice what they have already learned, and reach the next language level in English and German language. We are always grateful to get involved new language instructors.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Academic Advisory is a one-on-one service where the online study part is individually structured according to the student’s pre-knowledge, needs, and goals. Speaking about short-term goals and how to achieve them with an advisor, helps students to apply self-organizational skills.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Forum enables students to exchange on module content on the study platform with each other.</p>

<p dir="ltr">

<p dir="ltr"><strong>MOOC Development</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">In the process of development and design of our core curriculum for our four study tracks -- Business and Economics, Social Sciences, Computer Science, and Engineering -- Kiron has identified substantial gaps in the current world-wide MOOCs offering. This results in an outcome where our curriculum team is sometimes unable to perfectly match certain modules with appropriate MOOCs in regards to desired learning outcomes or desired workload.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Therefore, Kiron seeks to enter into a partnership with MOOC producing universities interested in producing online courses, i.e. MOOCs which would reflect our curriculum needs.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Step 1: Establishing contact and sharing the Gap Lists</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">After the initial contact, the responsible person at Kiron and at the academic partner institution coordinate the combined efforts towards establishing a partnership. In this step, Kiron staff also shares with the interested academic partner institution Gap Lists for all the study tracks, which contain detailed description of the modules Kiron is interested in matching with newly produced MOOCs, as well as the list of learning outcomes each pertaining to the specific module.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Step 2. Capturing mutual goals in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">The Academic Partner and Kiron agree on detailed goals of the partnership as well as their intention to work together by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Kiron and the Academic Partner desire to enter into an MoU to engage in a relationship between the two organizations where Kiron may direct prospective students to one or more courses on the Academic Partner’s platform. Furthermore, the Academic Partner agrees to produce online course(s) reflecting the needs of Kiron in terms of the desired learning outcomes within specific study program(s).&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>If you are a MOOC producing University and are interested in offering your courses (MOOCs) to Kiron students with free access and free certificates, please get in touch with us! Kiron is always on a search to improve our existing curriculum by implementing high-quality MOOCs into our offering.</strong></em></p>
