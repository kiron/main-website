<p>​</p><h2>Student Life</h2><p>Student life at Kiron cannot be described as easily as at conventional universities. Our students have the most diverse backgrounds one could imagine. Some may still be located in their home countries searching for a way to continue their education or thinking about leaving the country. Others may already be searching for refuge but don´t want to give up their education for that time or they are awaiting a legal court decision in a refugee camp hands tied to work or study for a long time. Again others may have arrived in their new home countries full of expectations of a better life but now facing the reality of long-lasting bureaucratic processes and poor chances to get into university, if any at all.</p><p>At Kiron, we recognize the huge variety of circumstances our students live in. That´s why we adapt our degree programmes to the needs of our students, meaning that they are optimized in flexibility and can be taken from everywhere with an internet access and a computer. This enables parents, university freshmen or students who have to work part time to study at a university in their very own pace.</p><p>But just because knowledge transfer at Kiron is online doesn´t mean that our students acquire their knowledge online. It´s completely the opposite actually. We believe that in order to acquire knowledge students have to experience. That´s why we focus on applying knowledge to real-world problems.</p><p>With conjoint forces of our local partners, we seek to establish a warm welcome culture for our Kiron Communities in every major city worldwide, including a campus of course.</p><p><strong>Kiron Campus in Berlin</strong></p><p>In Berlin, we seek to establish our own campus and several smaller campuses of our partner universities – facilities where students will have the chance to meet and exchange. In our view, the campus of the future looks and functions more like a co-working space: there are big classrooms for self-organised meetings and working groups. Additional physical workshops, language courses, tutoring and mentoring will also be provided.</p><p><strong>Access to the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin</strong></p><p><img src="https://kiron.ngo/storage/app/media/staatsbibliothek.jpg" data-verified="redactor"></p><p>The Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin opens its services to all Kiron students and provides real-world seminars in scientific working and writing in their own facilities - exclusively for Kiron students.</p><p><strong>Access to facilities of Macromedia Hochschule Berlin</strong></p><p><img src="https://kiron.ngo/storage/app/media/macromedia.jpg" data-verified="redactor"></p><p>Our local partner, Macromedia University Berlin, provides its facilities for events, workshops and welcome parties. Macromedia Campus is located in Mehringdamm - one of the most beautiful and central areas of Berlin. Also, members of Macromedia faculty will invite selected Kiron students to act as Co-Teacher in subjects like management and economics, thereby improving the student’s teaching skills and enabling them to train fellow refugees in return.<br></p><p>You will not get around without getting to know each other! Neither during your study programme, in which you will be working on various projects in small multicultural teams online and offline, nor outside of your studies!</p><p>Students at Kiron, can organise study groups, student initiatives, meetings, events, dinner nights and parties with their fellow students. But even more, our students will have the choice of several locations worldwide in order to do so and can always count on our support for that!</p>
