<p>Kiron is currently looking for a <strong>Head of Business Development&nbsp;</strong>to lead our operations in Istanbul.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kiron Open Higher Education (gGmbH) is a non-profit organization with a mission to remove barriers to access higher education for displaced people, asylum seekers, and refugees. Our goal is to empower young people through higher education degrees. After studying online for two years, Kiron students spend their third year of study at one of our partner universities and, through the cooperation with our partner schools, are able to earn an accredited university degree. As a growing social startup based in Berlin with regional chapters in Munich, Aachen, London, Paris, Brussels, Istanbul, and Boston, we are working hard on the realization of this concept. In October 2015, the first 1000 students began their online courses. With our core team of over 60 people as well as over 200 volunteers, and the cooperation of about 50 professors worldwide, we are driving the mission to give refugees around the world an opportunity to pursue their higher education careers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kiron Open Higher Education gGmbH has assumed operations in Turkey. A key target for Kiron’s programs is the group of approximately 3 million predominantly Syrian refugees in Turkey, of which 10% (about 300,000) are in between the age of 18 and 25.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Head of Business Development will join Kiron Turkey as part of the launch of the Certificate and Mentorship Programme. The Head of Business Development should have knowledge of the Turkish Higher Education sector and ideally, can contribute through her/his previous work experience and relations to institutions of higher education.&nbsp;</p>
