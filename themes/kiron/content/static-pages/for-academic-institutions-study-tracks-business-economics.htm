<h1 dir="ltr">Business &amp; Economics</h1>

<p dir="ltr">The Business &amp; Economics core curriculum offers the best of both worlds: Through our Economics modules, students will understand on a theoretical level how modern economies function and integrate into a larger social framework, while in our Business modules, students will learn on a practical level how to lead a business organization. Going through our Business &amp; Economics track and completing their degree at a partner university equips students with a set of both intellectual and hands-on skills that make them particularly valuable job market candidates.

	<br>An exemplary module in the Business &amp; Economics track is “Marketing”.</p>
