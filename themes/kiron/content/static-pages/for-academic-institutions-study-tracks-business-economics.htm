<h1 dir="ltr">Business &amp; Economics</h1>

<p dir="ltr">The Business &amp; Economics core curriculum offers the best of both worlds: Through our Economics modules, students will understand on a theoretical level how modern economies function and integrate into a larger social framework, while in our Business modules, students will learn on a practical level how to lead a business organization. Going through our Business &amp; Economics track and completing their degree at a partner university equips students with a set of both intellectual and hands-on skills that make them particularly valuable job market candidates.</p>

<p dir="ltr">An exemplary module in the Business &amp; Economics track is “Politics &amp; Economics”, which blends economic analysis with applications to current real-world challenges.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Description</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">This module is designed to introduce students to those parts of economics that bear an especially close connection to pressing social issues. Students will be familiarized with exemplary political debates that have an economic dimension, or whose analysis can be helpfully furthered by using the tools of economics. Likewise, they will be sensitized to some of the political, social and ethical dimensions to economic decisions. Possible case studies discuss economic policy-making, economic growth, distributive justice, social choice, behavioral economics and the ethics of nudge, financial crises, energy and environmental economics, happiness research or the ethics and economics of future generations.</p>
