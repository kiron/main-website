<p>The Kiron Research team is dedicated to scientific research within Kiron, with a focus on the topics of education and of migration. Our aim is to provide a way for individuals conducting research to further their own knowledge, while at the same time helping Kiron to make scientifically informed decisions about its programs and methods.</p><p>We coordinate people who have an academic interest in Kiron, and generate academic publications which can act as valuable resources for all those working on the topics of education and migration, whether in an academic or practical context.</p><p>For more information, please contact:</p><p><img src="/storage/app/media/team-portraits/lisahillers.jpg" data-verified="redactor" class="fr-dii fr-draggable"></p><p><a href="mailto:lisa.hillers@kiron.ngo">Lisa Hillers</a>, Lead Research Coordinator</p><h3>Research Projects</h3><p>Kiron is involved in research across a variety of topics of current academic interest.</p><p><strong>CHANGE MA(R)KER – How Refugee Students Become Entrepreneurs<span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p>In 2015, nearly 244 million people, about three percent of the world’s population, live outside their country of birth. According to estimates by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) app. 60 million of them, the highest number ever recorded, were forcibly displaced and in need of assistance and protection.</p><p>Whether forced to leave or migrated intentionally, some of them may be (born) entrepreneurs.</p><p>According to the Gallup World Poll (2013), migrants living in high-income economies are more likely than the native-born to have three characteristics that differentiate entrepreneurs from the rest: they keep optimistic even when things go wrong, they never give up, and they are willing to take risks.</p><p>What international migrants and refugees all have in common is the will to make the best of the little resources they may have.</p><p>Their ability to perceive and create new business opportunities and innovative ideas is at the heart of this longitudinal research project investigating the entrepreneurship potential among Kiron refugee students. Linking entrepreneurship and empowerment, this research project furthermore explores the role of education in venture creation and identifies support mechanisms to promote entrepreneurship among refugees as important agents of change.</p><p>The project is led by Dr. Maren Borkert and Daphne Hering from the Chair of Entrepreneurship and Innovation Management at the Technical University Berlin.</p><p>For more information please contact: <a href="mailto:m.borkert@tu-berlin.de"><span>m.borkert@tu-berlin.de</span></a></p><p><br></p><p><span><strong>The Moving Network</strong></span></p><p>The research project "The Moving Network" looks at effects of the current refugee crisis in the context of capacity building. Focusing on issues of empowerment (vgl. Rappaport, 1981) it makes obvious the role of "multipliers" in encouraging communal and collective participation. Results of the extensive interviews that were, in part, conducted with Kiron Students, will help lay the foundation for the "Kiron Ambassador" program.</p><p>In April 2016 the first publication of the project will be published and presented in Berlin.<br>Experts: Prof. Dr. Ayad Al-Ani, Dr. Patrick Föhl, Prof. Dr. Gernot Wolfram<br>Head of the student project team at Macromedia University: Mafalda Sandrini.</p><p>Contact: <a href="mailto:G.Wolfram@macromedia.de">Prof. Dr. Gernot Wolfram</a></p>
