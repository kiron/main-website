<p>The Kiron Research team is dedicated to scientific research within Kiron, with a focus on the topics of education and of migration. Our aim is to provide a way for individuals conducting research to further their own knowledge, while at the same time helping Kiron to make scientifically informed decisions about its programs and methods.
</p><p>We coordinate people who have an academic interest in Kiron, and generate academic publications which can act as valuable resources for all those working on the topics of education and migration, whether in an academic or practical context.

</p><h3>Research Projects</h3><p>Kiron is involved in research across a variety of topics of current academic interest.&nbsp;​</p><h4> The Moving Network <br>
</h4><p>The research project "The Moving Network" looks at effects of the current refugee crisis in the context of capacity building. Focusing on issues of empowerment (vgl. Rappaport, 1981) it makes obvious the role of "multipliers" in encouraging communal and collective participation. Results of the extensive interviews that were, in part, conducted with Kiron Students, will help lay the foundation for the "Kiron Ambassador" program.
</p><p>In April 2016 the first publication of the project will be published and presented in Berlin.<br>Experts: Prof. Dr. Ayad Al-Ani, Dr. Patrick Föhl, Prof. Dr. Gernot Wolfram<br>Head of the student project team at Macromedia University: Mafalda Sandrini.
