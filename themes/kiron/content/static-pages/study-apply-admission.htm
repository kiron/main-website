<h4> How to apply for the third and fourth year at a partner university</h4>
<p>
  For the first and second year studying at Kiron, you do not require any documents, except for your immigration status document (as described above).
   The following information is only important for years three and four, where you are encouraged to apply to a partner university.
    In order to access institutions of higher education in Germany, applicants need to provide a suitable university entrance qualification,
    called Hochschulzugangsberechtigung (HZB). This system is universal for all institutions in Germany.
    For all other partner universities, please check their individual requirements.
</p>

<h4>HOW TO CHECK YOUR ELIGIBILITY FOR BACHELOR DEGREES</h4>

<p>To confirm that you are eligible to directly enter a Bachelor degree programme at a German university with your
   current level of educational achievements, you have to check the classification of your academic
   qualifications:
 </p>
 <ol>
   <li>
     Visit the database of foreign secondary school qualifications on the website of the Central Office for Foreign Education (ZAB) called anabin.
      This website is in German, but by following the instructions you will still be able to check your qualifications
   </li>
   <li>
     <a href="http://anabin.kmk.org/no_cache/filter/schulabschluesse-mit-hochschulzugang.html#land_gewaehlt" target="_blank">Go to anabin</a>
   </li>
   <li>
     Select your home country or the country in which you obtained your academic qualification from the dropdown list.
   </li>
   <li>
     Find your qualification on the list and click on it. The pop-up window that now opens displays the evaluation of your qualification.
     ‘Direkter Zugang’ means that you do not need any further qualifications to be allowed to study in Germany.
   </li>
   <li>
     In certain cases, qualifications will have to be judged on an individual basis (‘Einzelfallentscheidung’).
     If this is the case, please contact the Jugendmigrationsdienst (JMD), which helps you in this and other queries you may have in this issue.
   </li>

   </li>
   <li>
     It may also say that you still have to take the "Feststellungsprüfung (FSP)" or visit a “Studienkolleg” to obtain the necessary
     German higher education entry qualification. The “Feststellungsprüfung” is a test that checks your education level and allows you to enter university
     if you pass. The terms and conditions for this test are defined individually by each Land in Germany.
   </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The above listed options are just some examples for access qualifications out of a range of different possibilities.
  We will check individually which one might be most appropriate to your individual circumstances.
</p>
