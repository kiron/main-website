<h1><strong>Internship Human Resources</strong></h1>

<p>Start: January 2017 or later - Duration: min. 3 months - Office: Berlin</p>

<p>Kiron Open Higher Education (gGmbH) is a non-profit organization with a mission to remove barriers to access higher education for displaced people, asylum seekers, and refugees. Our goal is to empower young people through higher education degrees. After studying online for two years, Kiron students spend their third year of study at one of our partner universities and, through the cooperation with our partner schools, are able to earn an accredited university degree. As a growing social startup based in Berlin with regional chapters in Munich, Aachen, London, Paris, Brussels, Istanbul, and Boston, we are working hard on the realization of this concept. In October 2015, the first 1250 students began their online courses. With our core team of over 70 people as well as over 400 volunteers, and the cooperation of about 50 professors worldwide, we are driving the mission to give refugees around the world an opportunity to pursue their higher education careers.
