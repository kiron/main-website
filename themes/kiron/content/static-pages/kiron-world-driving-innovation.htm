<p>Kiron Innovation is the space where social entrepreneurship, innovation and expertise come together.</p>

<h3>Meet the Innovation Projects</h3>

<p>Projects with a promising team of social entrepreneurs and an idea which is in line with the vision of Kiron are internally incubated inside of Kiron. Our entrepreneurs get access to space at Kironâ€™s offices and support from all our departments, gaining form our expertise in marketing, accounting, and technology, for instance. The projects get an internal Kiron Mentor, who helps them to develop their model and get ready to become a self-sustained project.</p>

<h4>Migration Hubs</h4>

<p>In collaboration with refugees, Migration Hub offers a network for initiatives that develop solutions for integration - from digital platforms to business ideas. We provide space and expert advice both online and offline to help innovators come up with ideas, gather feedback and share knowledge. The idea is to support initiatives in working independently, and to encourage refugees themselves to be at the forefront of innovation in integration solutions.</p>
