<h1 dir="ltr">Kiron At A Glance</h1>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Less than 1% of refugees globally have access to higher education.</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">At Kiron, we believe that everybody has the right to fulfill their potential and improve their life prospects through education. We know that the obstacles refugees face in accessing education can be overcome.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Our vision is to provide millions of refugees worldwide with the opportunity to graduate with an accredited university degree, free of charge. No more time, potential, or lives wasted.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Kiron uses an innovative combination of online and offline learning to provide accessible, sustainable, and cost-effective education. To date, we have over 1,500 students on the platform, 22 partner universities, and 4 study tracks.</p>

<p dir="ltr">But Kiron offers much more than just online learning. We believe in blended learning, where online courses are complemented with live and direct online tutoring and offline services like our Buddy Programme, Mentoring Programme, Study Hubs and Career Services. With a diverse range of partners, we strive to create an education model that is more accessible, more human-centred, and more supportive of personal growth.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We are at the forefront of driving innovation and research in education and migration solutions. Our network of educational, entrepreneurial, and research initiatives is aimed at targeting the broader issues of migration and developing pedagogy in the digital age.</p>
