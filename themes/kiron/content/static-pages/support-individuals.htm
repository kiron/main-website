<h2>Donating to Kiron</h2><p>Philanthropic support plays an integral role in the future development of Kiron. Even though we are seeking to establish sustainable revenue streams, the number of seats for Kiron students at our partner universities depends on the donations we receive during the first years of our project. Each place for a refugee to study a 3-year bachelor program for free is associated with a 3,000 Euro cost for Kiron.
</p><p>In order to ensure the transparency of all donations coming in, we are collaborating with established Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and refugee organisations to create external check-and-balances. In cooperation with our partners, Kiron publishes an annual evaluation, including the amount of donations received and the impact achieved.
</p><p>Donations can be made through <a href="https://www.betterplace.org/de/projects/36608-ermogliche-gefluchteten-ein-studium/donations/new#eft" target="_blank">Better Place</a> or via bank transfer to:

</p><h2>Volunteering</h2><p>Kiron is an international institution with students from more than 60 countries and an even more diverse range of cultural backgrounds. Our team reflects this international buzzing atmosphere. We work with people from all over the world, combining educational diversity and international experience with start-up expertise. Our team members and volunteers are one of our key strengths: everyone comes with diverse experiences, but is united by the same belief in the right to education. Kiron offers a range of volunteering and internship opportunities in our head office in Berlin, as well as in our teams in Boston, Istanbul and Munich. In many cases, it is also possible to work remotely from wherever you are located.
