<p>​In order to access higher education institutions in Germany, applicants need to provide a German University entrance qualification, called Hochschulzugangsberechtigung (hereinafter referred to as HZB). For partner universities in other countries, please check the university’s individual requirements on their website. If you need any help with this, don’t hesitate to contact student support.</p><p><img src="/storage/app/media/stock-images/university-campus.jpg" data-verified="redactor"></p><p><br></p><p><strong>How to Check your Eligibility for a Bachelor Degree. </strong></p><p>To confirm that you are eligible to enter a Bachelor degree programme at a German university with your current level of educational achievement, you will need to check the classification of your academic qualifications.</p><p>Visit the database of foreign secondary school qualifications, '<a href="http://anabin.kmk.org/" target="_blank">anabin</a>', on the website of the Central Office for Foreign Education (ZAB). This website is in German, but by following these instructions you will be able to check your qualifications even if you don't know much German yet.</p><ol>
	<li>Go to <a href="http://anabin.kmk.org/" target="_blank">anabin</a>.</li>
	<li>Select your home country or the country in which you obtained your academic qualification from the dropdown list.</li>
	<li>Find your qualification on the list and click on it. The pop-up window that now opens displays the evaluation of your qualification. ‘Direkter Zugang’ means that you do not need any further qualifications to be allowed to study in Germany.</li>
	<li>In certain cases, qualifications will have to be judged on an individual basis (‘Einzelfallentscheidung’). If this is the case, please contact the Jugendmigrationsdienst (JMD), which helps you in this and other queries you may have in this issue.</li>
	<li>The pop-up may also say that you have to take the "Feststellungsprüfung (FSP)", or visit a “Studienkolleg” to obtain the necessary German higher education entry qualification. The “Feststellungsprüfung” is a test that checks your education level and allows you to enter university if you pass. The terms and conditions for this test are defined individually by each federal state in Germany. As our partner universities are located in different federal states, we will find the test that is most appropriate for your situation and study plans.</li>
	<li>The federal states of Germany have agreed on a common approach in cases where refugees can not fully prove their university entrance qualification with documents. They have therefore implemented a three-step process to ensure the verification of an applicant’s ability to study, which is always done individually.</li>
</ol><p>The above listed options are just some examples. We will check individually which one might be most appropriate to your individual circumstances, and support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to get in touch with Student Support if you need help.</p>
