<p>Philanthropic support plays an integral
role in the future development of Kiron. Even though we are seeking to
establish sustainable revenue streams, the number of seats at our partner
universities heavily depends on the donations we receive during the first
years. Kiron will only be able to solve problems for refugees as a world-class
institution with the support of alumni, friends and charitable organisations.
In order to ensure total transparency for all donations coming in, we are
partnering with established Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and refugee
organisations to create external check-and-balances. In cooperation with our
partners, we will publish an annual evaluation including the amount of
donations received and how much impact we were able to create.
</p><p>
Our very first crowdfunding campaign on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.startnext.com/kironuniversity">startnext</a> makes 447 SCHOLARSHIPS for three years! Your support gives not only opportunities to so many people, but also the strength for us to keep up our work - we are incredibly GRATEFUL! 
</p><p>Please note that Kiron is a non-profit
institution and that you will therefore receive a tax reduction for every
donation!<br><br>
