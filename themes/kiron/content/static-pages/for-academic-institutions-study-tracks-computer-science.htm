<h1>Computer Science</h1>

<p>The Kiron Computer Science curriculum gives a profound introduction to the mathematical and engineering basics of the discipline and equips students with the tools and knowledge necessary for a successful research, industrial and entrepreneurial career in computing. A set of "core" courses gives students a thorough foundation in mathematical tools, programming principles, algorithms and complexity, and computing systems. It also provides considerable flexibility in course selection around topics such as Cryptography, Artificial Intelligence, Statistics and Web Programming. Students completing the Computer Science study tracks will have a depth of knowledge and an understanding of the research frontiers in at least one subfield of computing in information systems and across science and engineering.
	<br>
	<br>An exemplary module in the Computer Science track is “Algorithms and Data Structures”.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><em>Example:&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Name:</em> Algorithms and Data Structures</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Workload:</em> 9 CP</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Description</em>
	<br>The module gives an introduction to the analysis and development of efficient algorithms as well as the interaction between algorithms and data structures. The topics of this module include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Runtime analysis: different types of runtime approximations (best-case, worst-case, expected runtime), asymptotic analysis of upper and expected complexity bounds, big O notation (definition and computation), important complexity classes (constant, logarithmic, linear, quadratic and exponential), methods for empirical performance evaluation, time and space trade-off</li>
	<li>Data structures: singly and doubly linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs</li>
	<li>Algorithms: sorting methods (e.g. Quicksort, Mergesort or Heapsort), graph algorithms (e.g. Dijkstra’s and Floyd’s algorithms, Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithm), Principles of Hashing (simple hashing functions, basic collision strategies, dynamic hashing methods, e.g. linear hashing).</li>
	<li>Algorithmic Strategies: Exhaustive search, greedy algorithms, Divide-and-conquer, recursive backtracking, branch-and-bound</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Learning Outcomes</em></p>

<p>After successfully completing this course, students will be able to</p>

<ul>
	<li>evaluate the runtime and memory requirements for a given algorithm,</li>
	<li>describe important complexity classes for the analysis of runtime and memory complexity,</li>
	<li>formally model and describe algorithmic problem settings,</li>
	<li>adapt the introduced data structures and algorithms to modified problem settings,</li>
	<li>develop efficient algorithms and data structures using algorithmic strategies,</li>
	<li>explain and apply different sorting algorithms,</li>
	<li>develop and implement programs based on the introduced algorithmic techniques,</li>
	<li>evaluate different solution approaches for a given problem based on formal analysis.</li>
</ul>
